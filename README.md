# Stroke Analysis

## Objective
A personal project of mine attempting to predict strokes in patients. For this project, I'll be using the R Programming Language to perform data visualization, analysis, and prediction techniques to answer the overarching question: "Is it possible to determine whether a given patient will have a stroke with the ten predictors provided in the dataset?"
